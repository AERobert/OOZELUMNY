One vendor sells olives, dates, spices,","local fruits and vegetables, bread, and salt.  A butcher sells beef, goat, mutton, chicken,","and even crocodile and ostrich (or so he claims).  An Egyptian vendor sells a huge variety","of perfumes and oils.  An art dealer sells painted urns and pots, panel paintings, and","painted marble sculpture.  Goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and tinsmiths have their own","row of stalls, noisy with hammering.  Fashions for sale","include traditional Greek chitons and himatia, shorter tunics more fit for Egypt,","Roman togas (which are like chitons but simply draped instead of fastened\u2014how crude!) and ","even saris and other garb from Eastern lands.

There are more women on the streets, suggesting their greater freedom.  ","Both men and women wear chitons that are draped over just","one shoulder instead of two, possibly because of the heat, though the women still preserve their modesty","through the careful use of pins.

","Though not so dark as the Nubians', their skin is dark enough that there could be no mistaking them","for Greek.","Some wear Greek chitons and himatia, but many continue to wear their traditional garb:","a simple linen wrap about the waist for men, and a dress with straps for women.","The Egyptian women wear heavy makeup, and the men often shave their heads.","You have heard that most of the Egyptians live in a slum in the western part of the city, where","the old Egyptian village of Rhacotis once stood.
