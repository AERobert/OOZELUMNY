With the help of Archimedes and Euclid, you can discover the steam engine, the germ theory of disease, or even robotic automata, thousands of years ahead of schedule.","","  Will you deplete the libraries of other cities to enrich your own? Achieve popularity for your scientific inventions, or protect the legacy of the empire? Will Ptolemy IV grow up hedonistic and selfish, or wise and just? Will you be ransomed by the pirate queen Nefertari, or can you win her over with your silver tongue?","","  The fate of the city of wonders is in your hands!","","  \u2022 Play as a brilliant inventor, a gifted speaker, or a life-saving doctor[n/]","  \u2022 Make great discoveries while protecting Prince Ptolemy IV from manipulators at court[n/]","  \u2022 Save famed mathematicians Archimedes and Euclid from untimely deaths[n/]","  \u2022 Based on the real life of Eratosthenes, ancient genius who calculated the size of the Earth[n/]","  \u2022 Save the Great Library and invent the steam engine two thousand years early!","","  [i]You can play the first chapter of the game for free.
