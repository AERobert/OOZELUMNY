This is your destiny.\",\"\",\"        The letter also said something about becoming a tutor to the young Ptolemy IV,\",\"        who will one day inherit the throne.

Alexandria is one of the most promising young empires to have arisen\",\"        from the ashes of Alexander the Great's empire.  Young Ptolemy IV will probably\",\"        one day be declared a god, like his father before him.  When he does become king,\",\"        your sage advice will be what shaped him.  Through your influence, you can shape an empire.\",\"\",\"        In addition to your duties as the young Ptolemy's advisor, the letter mentioned that you\",\"        will also be expected to contribute to the management of the Great Library.  That\",\"        is all well and good, but you must not become too distracted.  The Great Library can\",\"        only be as great as its benefactor.

He already makes frequent\",\"        trips to Alexandria, and you think you could convince him to stay if you really tried.\",\"\",\"        Your new jobs are also exciting, no question:  by the request of Ptolemy III himself, you\",\"        will be both a librarian at the Great Library and a tutor to young Ptolemy IV.  But\",\"        foolishly or not, you are moving because you were lonely in Cyrene, and your excitement\",\"        to work in the library and Ptolemy's court are secondary to your happiness at once\",\"        again being in the presence of genius.\",\"\",\"        *return\",\"    #I plan to manipulate the royal family until they are dead and I rule Alexandria.\",\"        *set evil true\",\"        When Ptolemy III summoned you, he never realized he was summoning a devil.\",\"\",\"        You have heard that Ptolemy III and his wife Berenice are somewhat poor\",\"        judges of character.  They already have at least one leech attached to\",\"        them, a social climber named Sosi-something who has managed to transcend his\",\"        low birth just by sucking up and doing odd jobs.  Apparently Ptolemy III\",\"        puts great faith in mathematicians such as yourself, and he still consults\",\"        the now-ancient Euclid, who advised his father and grandfather as well.\",\"\",\"        When Ptolemy III offered to make you the unborn prince's future tutor,\",\"        you thought about these propositions and what you could deduce from them,\",\"        and you formed a plan.  You will take advantage of the trust that\",\"        Ptolemy III puts in his scholars.  And you will teach Ptolemy IV.  But in teaching\",\"        the young prince, you will make him just a little soft.  He won't want to think\",\"        hard about things; he'll ask you what to do.  Oh yes, you'll build up his trust,\",\"        too; you'll make him trust you even more than his parents.\",\"\",\"        Next step: get rid of the parents.  Maybe you can convince Ptolemy IV to off them;\",\"        maybe you'll build up your skill in Medicine to poison them; or maybe some other\",\"        schemer will do the dirty work for you.  When Ptolemy IV ascends the throne, you\",\"        will be the person he trusts most, and he will do whatever you say.  Once he has\",\"        a child, he will name you regent, and you will finally have no more use for him at all.\",\"\",\"        But your plan will take a long time to come to fruition, so for now, you play the\",\"        loyal scholar, doing scholarly things at the library until the prince is born.\",\"        *set medicine +2\",\"        *set rhetoric +1\",\"        *set petty %+ 10\",\"        *set arch_rel %- 10\",\"        *set berenice_rel %- 5\",\"        *set ptolemy_3_rel %- 5\",\"        *set ptolemy_4_rel %+ 5\",\"\",\"        *return\",\"*label nameChoice\",\"*choice\",\"    #\\\"Eratosthenes.\\\"  (Male)\",\"        *set male true\",\"        *set name \\\"Eratosthenes\\\"\",\"        *return\",\"    #\\\"Sophia.\\\" (Female)\",\"        *set male false\",\"        *set name \\\"Sophia\\\"\",\"        *return\",\"    #I'm a man by a different name.\",\"        *set male true\",\"        *gosub nameEntry\",\"        *return\",\"    #I'm a woman by a different name.\",\"        *set male false\",\"        *gosub nameEntry\",\"        *return\",\"\",\"*label nameEntry\",\"What is your name?\",\"*input_text name\",\"${name}, is that right?\",\"*choice\",\"    #Yes.\",\"        *return\",\"    #No, let me try again.\",\"        *goto nameEntry\",\"\",\"*label sosibius\",\"As you look out on the ocean, a gaunt, bearded man wearing a fine purple chiton\",\"comes to join you at the ship's prow.
